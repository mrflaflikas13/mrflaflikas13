                Soccer, also known as football in some countries, is a team sport between 2 teams, each with 11 players. Its venue is anything which has a rectangular field and 2 goal nets at each end of the pitch. Soccer is played with a spherical ball. 
                The primordial objective of the game is to score goals, which only requires to make the ball cross beyond the goal line of the goal net, no matter how its done. The exception is if you use your hands or arms; likewise, you cannot use 
                these in any part of the pitch, except when a "throw-in" occurs. A throw-in is when the ball goes out of the boundaries of the rectangular field, and a player needs to throw the ball back in the field with the hands. It is important to mention
                that players can circulate the ball wherever they want, but a player canot receive a pass if they are in the opponent's field side and they are closer than the ball and the nearest player from the goal line (the goalkeeper is excluded).  A penalty 
                can happen if during the playing time a player fouls an opposing player in the penalty box. Foul means when a player uses physical contact against aother player and does not hit to the ball before msking the tackle.Possible 
                sanctions are yellow card or red card, the latter means that you cannot play anymore for the rest of the game. Goalkeepers are the only players who can grab the ball, but only inside the penalty box, otherwise it is a foul!

                The team with the most goals scored wins the game. Playing time varies, but at professional level it is 90 minutes, with 2 half times of 45 minutes.If there is a draw in the number of goals, then there is extra time (30 minutes) and if there is still a draw, the game 
                ends in penalties, where teams alternate turns in a player shooting the ball from inside the penalty box against the opposing's team goalkeeper to score a goal. There are 5 penalty kicks for each team. 
                The equipment can be any attire, but in official/formal matches, players need to wear a shirt, shorts, socks, and shin guards. Technology specialized to assist during a game include VAR, which is a collection of replays of a certain scene that referees may check, 
                and goal-line technology which proves if a ball is over the line or not. During a game, teams may bring forth substitutions, but maximum 3, to replace players who are currently playing. FIFA, the international body that reigns football
                estimated that there were 250 million players and 1.3 billion soccer followers, thus it is the most popular sport in the world.
